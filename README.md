# Hand Gesture Controlled Particle System

An interactive real-time particle system controlled using hand gestures captured via a camera.
Built using Three.js and computer vision techniques, the system generates dynamic particle-based
shapes with physics effects such as gravity and collision.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture tracking using camera
- Dynamic particle shapes and templates
- Physics-based effects including gravity and collision
- Interactive visual feedback

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- Three.js
- MediaPipe / Hand Tracking
- HTML, CSS

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open index.html using a local server
3. Allow camera access when prompted
